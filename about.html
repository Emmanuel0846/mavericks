            <p>It is inconceivable what the Christian experience would be without music. Music is a universal language, obliterating lines, arbitrary or deliberate, that divide the world’s countries. Gospel music achieves this aim, specifically for Christians. Thus, gospel artists, especially those who are consistent in delivering soul-lifting harmonies from time to time, are often revered. But in some cases, gospel artistes achieve a special status by managing to entrench themselves in our consciousness by churning more unique musical outputs beyond the regular spirit-moving melodies. In even fewer instances, these artistes join to form a band. One of such audacious bands is Maverick City Music.</p>
            <p>Maverick City Music is a contemporary American Music collective and record label founded by Jonathan Jay and Tony Brown in 2018. Before then, the duo had been part of a band called House Fires, and had written very popular songs, including “Good Good Father” and “Build My Life.” They had also hosted several songwriting camps for hundreds of Christian artistes and songwriters, creating a community of Christian worshippers this way. During this period, they noticed a gap in the Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) industry. They could see that there wasn’t diversity, that the highly competitive industry did not let newbies thrive, especially those from cities like Atlanta. In a bid to create a safe space for these artistes, Maverick City Music was born. Prominent members of the band include Dante Bowe, Chandler Moore, Naomi Raine, Joe L Barnes, Brandon Lake, amongst others.</p>
